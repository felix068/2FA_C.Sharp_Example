# 2FA_C.Sharp_Example

This repository contains an example C# project for implementing Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using the Google.Authenticator library. The project is intended to be used on Linux.

## Repository Contents

- **2FA_Demo_Generator**: Folder containing the source code for generating a two-factor key.
- **2FA_Demo_Verify**: Folder containing the source code for verifying a two-factor code.
- **.gitattributes**: Git configuration file specifying attributes of files in the repository.
- **README.md**: This file.

## Compilation

The program can be compiled using the provided Make_Compile.sh file in the 2FA_Demo_Generator and 2FA_Demo_Verify folders. Follow the steps below to compile the project:

1. Make sure you have the .NET Core runtime installed on your Linux system. You can download it from the official [.NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

2. Navigate to either of the following folders: 2FA_C.Sharp_Example/2FA_Demo_Generator or 2FA_C.Sharp_Example/2FA_Demo_Verify.

3. Open a terminal in that folder.

4. Run the following command to compile the project:

./Make_Compile.sh

This command uses the dotnet runtime to publish the application in Release mode, specifying the linux-x64 execution environment, and creating a single self-contained executable file.

5. Once the compilation is complete, you can run the program using the following command:

./<Program_Name>

Replace `<Program_Name>` with the name of the generated executable file.

## Usage

The project consists of two independent programs:

- **2FA_Demo_Generator**: Allows you to generate a two-factor key and verify its validity by scanning a QR code or manually entering a key.
- **2FA_Demo_Verify**: Allows you to verify the validity of a two-factor code by entering a secret key and the code generated by the application.

Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal when running the programs to interact with them.

Please note that this project is intended for demonstration purposes and should be adapted and strengthened for production use.

## Code Explanation

### 2FA_Demo_Generator

The `Main` method in the `Program.cs` file of the `2FA_Demo_Generator` folder performs the following steps:

1. Creates a new instance of the `TwoFactorAuthenticator` class from the Google.Authenticator library.
2. Prompts the user to enter the application name, username, and secret key.
3. Generates a setup code using the provided information.
4. Displays the QR code setup image URL and the manual entry key for the user to configure their 2FA application.
5. Prompts the user to enter the 2FA code generated by the application.
6. Validates the entered code by calling the `ValidateTwoFactorPIN` method of the authenticator instance.
7. Returns a message indicating whether the 2FA key is valid or invalid.

### 2FA_Demo_Verify

The `Main` method in the `Program.cs` file of the `2FA_Demo_Verify` folder performs the following steps:

1. Creates a new instance of the `TwoFactorAuthenticator` class from the Google.Authenticator library.
2. Prompts the user to enter the secret key and the 2FA code generated by the application.
3. Validates the entered code by calling the `ValidateTwoFactorPIN` method of
4. Returns a message indicating whether the 2FA code is valid or invalid.
